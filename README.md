# hyxel

.. is meant to become an experimental ray-traced **4D "bloxel" game**, written from scratch in C# using [SDL2-CS](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS). Its purpose is to find out what a game with 4 spatial dimensions and full freedom of movement would play like and how the forth dimension could be visualized. Think *Minecraft* but with tesseracts instead of cubes. That's.. not really helping, is it?

The name "hyxel" is a portmanteau of *hyper* and *voxel*. Technically, one 4D equivalent of *volume* is *content*, but "coxel" has a weird ring to it, and I can't quite figure out why.
